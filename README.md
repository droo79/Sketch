# Sketch
Sketch, a modern minimal take on the etch-a-sketch.

A good project for me. I got very familiar with CSS Grid and it's related functions, ended up making the grid dynamic with user input. Improved my javascript and general html/CSS skills by a lot. Event listeners, and javascript interacting with HTML/CSS were big parts of Sketch.
